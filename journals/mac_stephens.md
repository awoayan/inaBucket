A Note: As I mentioned to Candice, in the spirit of learning, we traded off sharing screens and group coding on most days. As you'll see reflected below, there were few days when we were off tackling our own issues until the very end of the project. 


6/25 - 6/26
    We started by creating our PinTrip wireframe and talked through the functionality of the website. 
6/27
    After creating our Issues and starting to work on our models, we realized that the drop-bucket connection would need to be many to many, which required us to go back to the wireframe and talk through foreign keys. Learned a bunch today about many to many.
6/28
    Today we decided we'd go with just SQL, forgoing migrations. We created our Docker-compose.yml 

7/8
    Today we worked on our API structure, changing our wireframe around a bit. We started looking at our authentication and authorization.

7/11
    It was authentication and authorization day for the team. We had to navigate the differences with our code because we weren't using migrations. This was my first real hands on experience with FastAPI, and it definitely is going to take some getting used to.

7/12:
    Today we added completed our authorization. We have tokens! Then we started working on our API. I began with buckets, walking through a get and create function with Amanda. 

13:
    Countinued working on our API. Today we were able to get almost all of the functionality for get and git
