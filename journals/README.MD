PinTrip is a web application that combines the best aspects of Pinterest and a traditional travel guide. With PinTrip, you can create virtual "buckets" to curate travel ideas, and each "drop" in your bucket represents a travel destination, activity, or recommendation. The main focus of PinTrip is to provide users with a central platform where they can organize and explore travel-related content contributed by other users.

How it works

Buckets 
Create your own personalized buckets to categorize and store your travel inspirations. Each bucket represents a specific theme or travel plan.

Drops
Add drops to your buckets to represent individual travel ideas or recommendations. A drop can include destination details, photos, descriptions, and more.

Homepage
The homepage displays all drops ever created by PinTrip users, offering a wide array of travel ideas and inspiration.

Bucket Pages
Access a page dedicated to your buckets, where you can see all the buckets you have created for easy organization.
Drop Pages: Explore all the drops ever created and find new inspirations from other users.
Save and Delete: Easily save drops from the homepage to your personal buckets or remove drops from your buckets when you no longer need them.
Update Drops: Modify and update the drops you have created to keep your travel ideas up-to-date.
