A. PinTrip is a web application that combines the best aspects of Pinterest and a traditional travel guide. With PinTrip, you can create virtual "buckets" to curate travel ideas, and each "drop" in your bucket represents a travel destination, activity, or recommendation. The main focus of PinTrip is to provide users with a platform where they can organize and explore travel-related content contributed by other users.


How it works -

Buckets 
Create your own personalized buckets to categorize and store your travel inspirations. Each bucket represents a specific theme or travel plan, you need to add a bucket title, a cover photo, and details.

Drops
Add drops to your buckets to represent individual travel ideas or recommendations. A drop can include destination details, location photo, drop name, city, address, URL, and a select bucket option.

Homepage
The homepage displays all drops ever created by PinTrip users, offering a wide variety of travel ideas and inspiration.

Bucket Pages
Access a page dedicated to your buckets, where you can see all the buckets you have created for easy organization.

Drop Pages
Explore all the drops ever created and find new inspirations from other users.

Save and Delete
Easily save drops from the homepage to your personal buckets or remove drops from your buckets when you no longer need them. Also if you created a drop and it matches your user ID you can delete that.

Update Drops
Modify and update the drops you have created to keep your travel ideas up-to-date.
